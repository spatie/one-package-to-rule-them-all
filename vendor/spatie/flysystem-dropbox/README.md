## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/flysystem-dropbox
```

## Upgrading from thephpleague/flysystem

[thephpleague/flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) under the hood uses v1 of the Dropbox API which will be turned off soon. Luckily upgrading is easy. Read [this blogpost](https://murze.be/2017/04/dropbox-will-turn-off-v1-of-their-api-soon-its-time-to-update-your-php-application/) to learn how to upgrade.

## Usage

The first thing you need to do is get an authorization token at Dropbox. A token can be generated in the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) for any Dropbox API app. You'll find more info at [the Dropbox Developer Blog](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/).

``` php
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
use Spatie\Dropbox\Client;
use Spatie\FlysystemDropbox\DropboxAdapter;

$client = new Client($authorizationToken);

$adapter = new DropboxAdapter($client);

$filesystem = new Filesystem($adapter, ['case_sensitive' => false]);
```
Note: Because Dropbox is not case-sensitive youâ€™ll need to set the 'case_sensitive' option to false.
