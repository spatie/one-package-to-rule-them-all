## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/interactive-slack-notification-channel
```

## Usage

In your `Notifiable` classes you should add a method named `routeNotificationForInteractiveSlack` that returns an array with the
API token, an optionally the channel name

```php
public function routeNotificationForInteractiveSlack()
{
    return [
        'token' => 'xoxp-slack-token',
        'channel' => '#general' // this is optional
    ];
}
```

### Replying to message threads

Let's assume you want your application to send a Slack notification when an order gets placed. You also want any
subsequent messages about the order be place in the same thread.

Using the SlackApi channels you can retrieve the API response from Slack's `chat.postMessage` method. With this response
you could post messages on other events that happen on the order, such as order paid, shipped, closed, etc.

Here's an example:

```php
use Spatie\InteractiveSlackNotificationChannel\Messages\SlackMessage

public function toInteractiveSlack($notifiable)
{
    return (new SlackMessage)->content('A new order has been placed');
}

public function interactiveSlackResponse(array $response)
{    
    $this->order->update(['slack_thread_ts' => $response['ts']]);
}
```

In your order paid event you can have

```php
use Spatie\InteractiveSlackNotificationChannel\Messages\SlackMessage;
use Spatie\InteractiveSlackNotificationChannel\Messages\SlackAttachment;

public function toInteractiveSlack($notifiable)
{
    $order = $this->order;

    return (new SlackMessage)
        ->success()
        ->content('Order paid')
        ->threadTimestamp($order->slack_thread_ts)
        ->attachment(function(SlackAttachment $attachment) use ($order) {
           $attachment
                ->title("Order $order->reference has been paid for.")
                ->content('Should now be processed.')
                ->action('View Order', route('orders', $order->reference));
       });
}
```

## Testing
