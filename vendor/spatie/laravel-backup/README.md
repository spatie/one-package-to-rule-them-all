This Laravel package [creates a backup of your application](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v7/taking-backups/overview). The backup is a zip file that contains all files in the directories you specify along with a dump of your database. The backup can be stored on [any of the filesystems you have configured in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem).

Feeling paranoid about backups? No problem! You can backup your application to multiple filesystems at once.

Once installed taking a backup of your files and databases is very easy. Just issue this artisan command:

``` bash
php artisan backup:run
```

But we didn't stop there. The package also provides [a backup monitor to check the health of your backups](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v7/monitoring-the-health-of-all-backups/overview). You can be [notified via several channels](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v7/sending-notifications/overview) when a problem with one of your backups is found.
To avoid using excessive disk space, the package can also [clean up old backups](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v7/cleaning-up-old-backups/overview).
