# Make some changes to your db
# ...

# Create another dump

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-db-snapshots
```

You should add a disk named `snapshots` to `app/config/filesystems.php` on which the snapshots will be saved. This would be a typical configuration:

```php
// ...
'disks' => [
    // ...
    'snapshots' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => database_path('snapshots'),
    ],
// ...    
```

Optionally, you may publish the configuration file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\DbSnapshots\DbSnapshotsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the content of the published file:

```php
return [

    /**
     * The name of the disk on which the snapshots are stored.
     */
    'disk' => 'snapshots',

    /**
     * The connection to be used to create snapshots. Set this to null
     * to use the default configured in `config/databases.php`
     */
    'default_connection' => null,

    /**
     * The directory where temporary files will be stored.
     */
    'temporary_directory_path' => storage_path('app/laravel-db-snapshots/temp'),

    /*
     * Create dump files that are gzipped
     */
    'compress' => false,
];
```

## Usage

To create a snapshot (which is just a dump from the database) run:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:create my-first-dump
```

Giving your snapshot a name is optional. If you don't pass a name the current date time will be used:

```bash
# Creates a snapshot named something like `2017-03-17 14:31`
php artisan snapshot:create
```

When creating snapshots, you can optionally create compressed snapshots.  To do this either pass the `--compress` option on the command line, or set the `db-snapshots.compress` configuration option to `true`:

```bash
# Creates a snapshot named my-compressed-dump.sql.gz
php artisan snapshot:create my-compressed-dump --compress
```

After you've made some changes to the database you can create another snapshot:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:create my-second-dump
```

To load a previous dump issue this command:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:load my-first-dump
```

To load a previous dump to another DB connection:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:load my-first-dump --connection=connectionName
```

To list all the dumps run:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:list
```

A dump can be deleted with:

```bash
php artisan snapshot:delete my-first-dump
```

To remove all backups except the most recent 2

```bash
php artisan snapshot:cleanup --keep=2
```

## Events

There are several events fired which can be used to perform some logic of your own:

- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\CreatingSnapshot`: will be fired before a snapshot is created
- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\CreatedSnapshot`: will be fired after a snapshot has been created
- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\LoadingSnapshot`: will be fired before a snapshot is loaded
- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\LoadedSnapshot`: will be fired after a snapshot has been loaded
- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\DeletingSnapshot`: will be fired before a snapshot is deleted
- `Spatie\DbSnapshots\Events\DeletedSnapshot`: will be fired after a snapshot has been deleted
