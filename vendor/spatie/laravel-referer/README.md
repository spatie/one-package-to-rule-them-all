Remember a visitor's original referer in session. The referer is (highest priority first):

- The `utm_source` query parameter
- The domain from the request's `Referer` header if there's an external host in the URL
- Empty

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-referer
```

The package will automatically register itself in Laravel 5.5. In Laravel 5.4. you'll manually need to register the `Spatie\Referer\RefererServiceProvider` service provider in `config/app.php`.

You can publish the config file with:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Referer\RefererServiceProvider"
```

Publishing the config file is necessary if you want to change the key in which the referer is stored in the session or
if you want to disable a referer source.

```php
return [

    /*
     * The key that will be used to remember the referer in the session.
     */
    'session_key' => 'referer',

    /*
     * The sources used to determine the referer.
     */
    'sources' => [
        Spatie\Referer\Sources\UtmSource::class,
        Spatie\Referer\Sources\RequestHeader::class,
    ],
];
```

## Usage

To capture the referer, all you need to do is add the `Spatie\Referer\CaptureReferer` middleware to your middleware stack. In most configuration's, you'll only want to capture the referer in "web" requests, so it makes sense to register it in the `web` stack. Make sure it comes **after** Laravel's `StartSession` middleware!

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        // ...
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
        // ...
        \Spatie\Referer\CaptureReferer::class,
        // ...
    ],
    // ...
];
```

The easiest way to retrieve the referer is by just resolving it out of the container:

```php
use Spatie\Referer\Referer;

$referer = app(Referer::class)->get(); // 'google.com'
```

Or you could opt to use Laravel's automatic facades:

```php
use Facades\Spatie\Referer\Referer;

$referer = Referer::get(); // 'google.com'
```

The captured referer is (from high to low priority):

- The `utm_source` query parameter, or:
- The domain from the request's `Referer` header if there's an external host in the URL, or:
- Empty

An empty referer will never overwrite an exisiting referer. So if a visitor comes from google.com and visits a few pages on your site, those pages won't affect the referer since local hosts are ignored.

### Forgetting or manually setting the referer

The `Referer` class provides dedicated methods to forget, or manually set the referer.

```php
use Facades\Spatie\Referer\Referer;

Referer::put('google.com');
Referer::get(); // 'google.com'
Referer::forget();
Referer::get(); // ''
```

### Changing the way the referer is determined

The referer is determined by doing checks on various sources, which are defined in the configuration.

```php
return [
    // ...
    'sources' => [
        Spatie\Referer\Sources\UtmSource::class,
        Spatie\Referer\Sources\RequestHeader::class,
    ],
];
```

A source implements the `Source` interface, and requires one method, `getReferer`. If a source is able to determine a referer, other sources will be ignored. In other words, the `sources` array is ordered by priority.

In the next example, we'll add a source that can use a `?ref` query parameter to determine the referer. Additionally, we'll ignore `?utm_source` parameters.

First, create the source implementations:

```php
namespace App\Referer;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Spatie\Referer\Source;

class RefParameter implements Source
{
    public function getReferer(Request $request): string
    {
        return $request->get('ref', ''); 
    }
}
```

Then register your source in the `sources` array. We'll also disable the `utm_source` while we're at it.

```php
return [
    // ...
    'sources' => [
        App\Referer\RefParameter::class,
        Spatie\Referer\Sources\RequestHeader::class,
    ],
];
```

That's it! Source implementations can be this simple, or more advanced if necessary.
