A tiny, opinionated package to enable or disable indexing your site via a middleware in Laravel.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require spatie/laravel-robots-middleware
```

## Usage

By default, the middleware enables indexing on all pages. You'll probably want to inherit your own class containing you application's indexing rule handler.  

```php
// app/Http/Middleware/MyRobotsMiddleware.php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Spatie\RobotsMiddleware\RobotsMiddleware;

class MyRobotsMiddleware extends RobotsMiddleware
{
    /**
     * @return string|bool
     */
    protected function shouldIndex(Request $request)
    {
        return $request->segment(1) !== 'admin';
    }
}
```

Next, simply register the newly created class in your middleware stack. 

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middleware = [
        // ...
        \App\Http\Middleware\MyRobotsMiddleware::class,
    ];
    
    // ...
}
```

That's it! Responses will now always have an `x-robots-tag` in their headers, containing an `all` or `none` value.
