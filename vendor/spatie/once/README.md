This package contains a `once` function. You can pass a `callable` to it. Here's quick example:

```php
$myClass = new class() {
    public function getNumber(): int
    {
        return once(function () {
            return rand(1, 10000);
        });
    }
};
```

No matter how many times you run `$myClass->getNumber()` inside the same request  you'll always get the same number.

## Are you a visual learner?

Under the hood, this package uses a PHP 8 Weakmap. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lFyHJqzfFU&list=PLjzBMxW2XGTwEwWumYBaFHy1z4W32TcjU&index=13), you'll see what a weakmap is, together with a nice demo of the package.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/once
```

## Usage

The `once` function accepts a `callable`.

```php
$myClass = new class() {
    public function getNumber(): int
    {
        return once(function () {
            return rand(1, 10000);
        });
    }
};
```

No matter how many times you run `$myClass->getNumber()` you'll always get the same number.

The `once` function will only run once per combination of argument values the containing method receives.

```php
class MyClass
{
    /**
     * It also works in static context!
     */
    public static function getNumberForLetter($letter)
    {
        return once(function () use ($letter) {
            return $letter . rand(1, 10000000);
        });
    }
}
```

So calling `MyClass::getNumberForLetter('A')` will always return the same result, but calling `MyClass::getNumberForLetter('B')` will return something else.

### Flushing the cache

To flush the entire cache you can call:

```php
Spatie\Once\Cache::getInstance()->flush();
```

### Disabling the cache

In your tests you probably don't want to cache values. To disable the cache you can call:

```php
Spatie\Once\Cache::getInstance()->disable();
```

You can re-enable the cache with

```php
Spatie\Once\Cache::getInstance()->enable();
```

## Under the hood

The `once` function will execute the given callable and save the result in the  `$values` property of `Spatie\Once\Cache`. This class [is a singleton](https://github.com/spatie/once/blob/9decd70a76664ff451fb10f65ac360290a6a50e6/src/Cache.php#L15-L27). When we detect that `once` has already run before, we're just going to return the value stored inside [the `$values` weakmap](https://github.com/spatie/once/blob/9decd70a76664ff451fb10f65ac360290a6a50e6/src/Cache.php#L11) instead of executing the callable again.

The first thing it does is calling [`debug_backtrace`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.debug-backtrace.php). We'll use the output to determine in which function and class `once` is called and to get access to the `object` that function is running in. Yeah, we're already in voodoo-land. The output of the `debug_backtrace` is passed to a new instance of `Backtrace`. That class is just a simple wrapper, so we can work more easily with the backtrace.

```php
$trace = debug_backtrace(
    DEBUG_BACKTRACE_PROVIDE_OBJECT, 2
)[1];

$backtrace = new Backtrace($trace);

$object = $backtrace->getObject();
```

Next, we calculate a `hash` of the backtrace. This hash will be unique per function `once` was called in and the values of the arguments that function receives.

```php
$hash = $backtrace->getHash();
```

Finally, we will check if there's already a value stored for the given hash. If not, then execute the given `$callback` and store the result in the weakmap of `Spatie\Once\Cache`. In the other case, we just return the value from that cache (the `$callback` isn't executed).

```php
public function has(object $object, string $backtraceHash): bool
{
    if (! isset($this->values[$object])) {

        return false;
    }

    return array_key_exists($backtraceHash, $this->values[$object]);
}
```
