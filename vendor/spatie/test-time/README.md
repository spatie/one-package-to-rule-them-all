[Carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon) is an excellent library to work with time in PHP projects. The `Spatie\TestTime\TestTime` class contains a few functions that under the hood manipulate the time that's considered the current time by Carbon.

```php
// the flow of time is frozen
TestTime::freeze();

// we're now one year in the future
TestTime::addYear();

// will report the real current year + 1
$year = (new Carbon())->format('Y');
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/test-time
```

## Usage

You can freeze the time with:

```php
TestTime::freeze();
```

Alternatively you can pass in a carbon instance that will be used as the current time.

```php
TestTime::freeze($carbonInstance);
```

You can also pass a format and time.

```php
TestTime::freeze('Y-m-d', '2019-06-12');
```

### Progressing time

You can progress the time with any of the carbon functions starting with `add` or `sub`.

```php
TestTime::addMinute();

TestTime::subHours(5);

// you can also chain calls
TestTime::addMonth(3)->addYear();
```

### Unfreezing time

To let time flow naturally again, call  `unfreeze`.

```php
TestTime::unfreeze();
```

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
