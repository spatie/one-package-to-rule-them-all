Twitter provides a streaming API with which you can do interesting things such as listening for tweets that contain specific strings or actions a user might take (e.g. liking a tweet, following someone,...). This package makes it very easy to work with the API.

Here's a quick example:

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenHears('@spatie_be', function(array $tweet) {
    echo "We got mentioned by {$tweet['user']['screen_name']} who tweeted {$tweet['text']}";
})->startListening();
```

 There's no polling involved. The package will keep an open https connection with Twitter, events will be delivered in real time.

Under the hood the [Phirehose package](https://github.com/fennb/phirehose) is used.

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment we highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Kruikstraat 22, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium.

The best postcards will get published on the open source page on our website.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/twitter-streaming-api
```

## Getting credentials

In order to use this package you'll need to get some credentials from Twitter. Head over to the [Application management on Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/) to create an application.

Once you've created your application, click on the `Keys and access tokens` tab to retrieve your `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token` and `access_token_secret`.

## Usage

Currently, this package works with the public stream and the user stream. Both the `PublicStream` and `UserStream` classes provide a `startListening` function that kicks of the listening process. Unless you cancel it your PHP process will execute that function forever. No code after the function will be run.

### The public stream

The public stream can be used to listen for specific words that are being tweeted, receive Tweets that are being sent from specific locations or to follow one or more users tweets.

#### Listen for Tweets containing specific words

The first parameter of `whenHears` must be a string or an array containing the word or words you want to listen for. The second parameter should be a callable that will be executed when one of your words is used on Twitter.

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenHears('@spatie_be', function(array $tweet) {
    echo "We got mentioned by {$tweet['user']['screen_name']} who tweeted {$tweet['text']}";
})->startListening();
```

#### Listen for Tweets from specific locations

The first parameter of `whenFrom` must be an array containing one or more bounding boxes, each as an array of 4 element lon/lat pairs (looking like `[<south-west point longitude>, <south-west point latitude>, <north-east point longitude>,  <north-east point latitude>]`). The second parameter should be a callable that will be executed when a Tweet from one of your tracked locations is being sent.

**Track all tweets from San Francisco or New York:**

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenFrom([
    [-122.75, 36.8, -121.75, 37.8], // San Francisco
    [-74, 40, -73, 41],             // New York
], function(array $tweet) {
        echo "{$tweet['user']['screen_name']} just tweeted {$tweet['text']} from SF or NYC";
})->startListening();
```

**Track all tweets with a location (from all over the world):**

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenFrom([
        [-180, -90, 180, 90] // Whole world
], function(array $tweet) {
    echo "{$tweet['user']['screen_name']} just tweeted {$tweet['text']} with a location attached";
})->startListening();
```

#### Listen for Tweets from specific users

The first parameter of `whenTweets` must be a string or an array containing the Twitter user ID or IDs you wish to follow. The second parameter should be a callable that will be executed when one of your followed users tweets. Only public information relating to the Twitter user will be available.

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenTweets('92947501', function(array $tweet) {
    echo "{$tweet['user']['screen_name']} just tweeted {$tweet['text']}";
})->startListening();
```

## Check filter predicates

In most cases your script will interacts with the Twitter streaming API as a daemon. If you want to change the filters while it is running you can pass a callable to `checkFilterPredicates`. That callable will be called every ~5 seconds.

Here's an example:

```php
PublicStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->whenHears('@spatie_be', function(array $tweet) {
    echo "We got mentioned by {$tweet['user']['screen_name']} who tweeted {$tweet['text']}";
})->checkFilterPredicates(function($stream) {
    $trackIds = ExternalStorage::get('TwitterTrackIds');
    if ($trackIds != $stream->getTrack()) {
        $stream->setTrack($trackIds);
    }
})->startListening();
```

If you run in an external script something like

```php
ExternalStorage::set('TwitterTrackIds', ['@spatie_be', '@laravelphp'])
```

then the method in the example above will change the filter predicates and reconnect to the Twitter streaming API.

 `ExternalStorage::get/set` is just a dummy example. In real apps you'll probably use a file, in memory cache or db for this.

### The user stream

```php
UserStream::create(
    $accessToken,
    $accessTokenSecret,
    $consumerKey,
    $consumerSecret
)->onEvent(function(array $event) {
    if ($event['event'] === 'favorite') {
        echo "Our tweet {$event['target_object']['text']} got favorited by {$event['source']['screen_name']}";
    }
})->startListening();
```

## A word to the wise

These APIs work in realtime, so they could report a lot of activity. If you need to do some heavy work processing that activity it's best to put that work in a queue to keep your listening process fast.
